## Planning

1. Generation 1 Home - Starter Pokemon
2. Generation 1 Safari : Maybe catch one of each to improve catch rate?
    * Maybe break into 3 tiers
    * Tier 1 - Easy pokemon - Ex: Weedle, Pidgey
    * Tier 2 - Medium pokemon - Ex: Lapars, Dratini
    * Tier 3 - Legendary pokemon - Ex: Mewtwo, Zapdos
3. Generation 1 Battle Tower : 50? trainers
    * Maybe break the safari into 3 battle towers based on the 3 tiers
4. Generation 2 Home - Starter Pokemon : Decide what to do with gen 1 pokemon
4. Generation 2 Safari
5. Generation 2 Battle Tower : 50? trainers
6. Generation 3 Home - Starter Pokemon
7. Generation 3 Safari
8. Generation 3 Battle Tower
